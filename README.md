#### OSPRA (Obtain the Shortest Path from REST APIs)
##### Given a source and a destination, obtains the shortest path with its estimated arrival time and its estimated distance from 7 REST APIs (Apple Maps, ArcGIS, Bing Maps, Google Maps, Mapbox, MapQuest, TomTom).
##### The following software is very different but I took inspiration from: https://github.com/gis-ops/routingpy, licensed under Apache License 2.0. It uses different REST APIs and it is used for different purposes. Also, this software needs the FlexPolyline library (https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline) which was slightly modified to handle NumPy arrays.
